<p>ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) (Basso 2005, Margolin 2006a, 2006b) is an information-theoretic algorithm used to identify transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray gene expression profile data.  By proper selection of samples, a tissue/phenotype-specific set of pairwise regulatory interactions can be obtained – an “interactome”.   Such an interactome can form the basis for more complex analysis of cellular regulatory networks. ARACNe has been used to reconstruct networks in mammalian cells through appropriate choice of dataset.
</p><p>For a dataset with a simple, monotonic relationship between input and output, analysis with a normal (e.g. Pearson's) correlation function may be the most suitable method.   Where the input/output function is non-linear or irregular, a method based on the calculation of mutual information, such as ARACNe, may be able to find relationships that Pearson's correlation will not find.  Calculation of the mutual information does not require a monotonic relationship. ARACNe has proven to be well suited for the reverse engineering of regulatory networks in the context of specific cellular types.
</p><p>ARACNe performs best with a dataset containing data from a minimum of 100 microarrays (see Margolin, Wang et al. 2006) and representing a number of different states of the same cellular system - for example,  cells lines of varying phenotype, or cells subjected to a variety of experimental perturbations.  Initial work with ARACNe was performed using a large collection (about 340) of B-cell lines of various phenotypes (Basso et al. 2005).  For the "Adaptive Partitioning" option, there is no upper limit on the number of arrays that can be included.  For the "Fixed Bandwidth" option, arrays in excess of 300 can lead to long computation times.  A subset of the B-Cell dataset, derived from 100 arrays, is included with geWorkbench (Bcell-100.exp).
</p><p>Within the constraints of available computational power and memory, the more samples that are used, the greater the accuracy of the mutual information calculation.
</p><p>ARACNe can perform two separate calculations:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Mutual Information</b>: The mutual information (MI) of one or more marker's expression profile(s) is calculated against all other active markers.
</li><li> <b>Data Processing Inequality (DPI)</b>: The DPI calculation is used to remove the weakest interaction (edge) between any three markers. That is, if a MI value is available between each of three possible pairings of three markers, the weakest interaction of the three will be removed from the output. This has the intent of removing indirect interactions. For example, if A-&gt;B-&gt;C, the indirect interaction A-&gt;C will likely be weaker than A-&gt;B or B-&gt;C and would be removed. A tolerance can be set which relaxes this screening to account for uncertainty in the MI calculation.

<p>Parameters described below allow one to incorporate a list of putative transcription factors and optimize the run to discover targets that they may regulate.
</p><p>Current versions of geWorkbench (starting with release 1.7.0) use a new implementation of ARACNe, ARACNe2, that supports two important new features:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Algorithm</b> - A new algorithm, termed "Adaptive Partitoning", which is much faster than the original "fixed bandwidth" method was added.
</li><li> <b>Mode</b> - The user can choose to custom-calculate optimal run parameters for a given dataset.  See the option "Preprocessing" below.
